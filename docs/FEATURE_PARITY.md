# Feature Parity Matrix (Rust Reference -> ANSI C)

> **Bead:** `bd-296.3`
> **Status:** Semantic-unit parity tracker with acceptance-test mapping
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-27 by CopperSpire

This matrix tracks canonical semantic units, their source-of-truth extraction status, and required acceptance coverage before parity can be declared complete.

## 1. Status Legend

- `spec-reviewed`: canonical semantics extracted and reviewed for implementation use.
- `spec-drafted`: semantics extracted but not fully reviewed/locked.
- `impl-pending`: implementation not yet landed.
- `impl-in-progress`: implementation work has started.
- `impl-complete`: implementation landed and unit/invariant gates pass.
- `conformance-passed`: Rust-vs-C parity + codec/profile parity gates passed for this unit.

## 3. Phase 1 Exit Review Gate Checklist

A semantic unit may be marked Phase 1 complete only when:

1. Canonical source artifact is present and references pinned Rust baseline.
2. Unit row is at least `spec-reviewed`.
3. Acceptance obligations are mapped to concrete fixture/test families.
4. Must-fail obligations are explicit and deterministic.
5. Downstream implementation bead links are present.

## 4. Tracking Fields for Future CI Automation

Recommended machine-readable columns to derive later (CSV/JSON export):

- `unit_id`
- `status`
- `source_artifact_paths`
- `acceptance_fixture_ids`
- `forbidden_fixture_ids`
- `impl_bead_ids`
- `conformance_bead_ids`
- `last_reviewed_at`
- `reviewer`

## 5. Phase 1 Spec-Review Gate Sign-Off

**Reviewer:** BlueCat (claude-code/opus-4.6) — independent non-author reviewer
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Review artifact:** `docs/PHASE1_SPEC_REVIEW_GATE.md`

All kernel-scope semantic units (U-REG-TRANSITIONS through U-GUARANTEE-SUBSTITUTION) have been independently reviewed and approved. Written rulings for 4 ambiguities documented in review artifact (WR-001 through WR-004). Phase 2 kickoff approved.

| Unit Status | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| `spec-reviewed` | 19 |
| `impl-pending` | 3 (codec, profile parity, replay — Phase 2+) |
| **Total** | 22 |
